### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Experienced Backup and Recovery Subject Matter Expert with 6 years in Backup As a Service area. Seeking a Front-End developer position with a team which will give me the opportunity to grow and learn.

During my career at IBM I went from having no idea about backups to an expert in 4 years. In the last 3 years, I've been involved with a total of 9 customers, participated in 6 onboardings, including 2 in which the technologies used were not previously offered by my team and which I had to learn from scratch during onboarding. My work is based on analyzing and implementing customer requirements, troubleshooting both server and client side issues on a daily basis, working closely with documentation and cooperating with people on different seniority level and technical backgrounds (40 in Poland, 130 worldwide).

Front-end development has always been a passion of mine. In the last year, I decided to turn this passion into a profession, so now instead of just doing it on the side and enjoying it. I'm diving into it headfirst in order to make sure that what I do is going to be the best possible version of myself.

Ideally, your project would be around Vue.js, but I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other technologies I can integrate into the coding web in my head.
